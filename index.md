# teamtomo.org - home
[teamtomo.org](https://teamtomo.github.io) is an *open* and *collaborative* platform for sharing knowledge in the cryo-electron tomography (cryo-ET) [community](https://twitter.com/hashtag/teamtomo).

Cryo-ET is a 3D imaging modality which uses [transmission electron microscopes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transmission_electron_microscopy) to image proteins, their assemblies and thin cellular sections in their native state with high spatial resolution.

Subtomogram averaging can be used to align and average many copies of the same object, increasing both the signal-to-noise ratio and interpretable resolution.

If you're new to cryo-ET and subtomogram averaging, check out our [overviews](general-principles/overviews/overviews) and data processing [guides](guides/index). Looking for something more specific? Check out our [mini-tutorials](mini-tutorials/mini-tutorials) and [general principles](general-principles/general-principles) sections!

Still haven't found what you were looking for? Ask the community by sending an email to the [CCP-EM mailing list](https://www.jiscmail.ac.uk/cgi-bin/webadmin?A0=CCPEM), or use [#teamtomo](https://twitter.com/hashtag/teamtomo) on Twitter.

We warmly welcome contributions from anyone willing to share their expertise! If you would like to contribute or suggest some changes, check out our [contribution guidelines](teamtomo/contributing/index).
