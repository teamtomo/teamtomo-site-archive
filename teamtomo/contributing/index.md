```{admonition} For a quick edit
:class: tip
If all you want to do is contribute to an existing page, you just need to click on the **Octocat** icon here at the top right and click on "suggest edit". It will bring you to GitHub, and let you quickly create a Pull Request with your edits.
```

The project is powered by [Jupyter Book](https://jupyterbook.org/intro.html), and it lives on [GitHub](https://github.com/teamtomo/teamtomo.github.io). Contributing is fairly painless, requiring only a minimum of familiarity with working at the command line.

Everything is written in `Markdown`, a simple markup language for plain text files. You can find a cheat sheet [here](https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/) and you can use the 
[repository](https://github.com/teamtomo/teamtomo.github.io) as a starting point.

We make use of the version control system [git](https://git-scm.com/) and the 
[Pull Request](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/about-pull-requests) mechanism on GitHub to manage contributions. If you're new to git and GitHub, check out our [short guide to git(hub)](git_guide) to learn how to set up a github account, fork this project and create a Pull Request with your contribution.

:class: attention
If you are already familiar with git and want to get started right away, you should know that to keep the size of the repository small and contributions easier to manage we use [git large files storage](https://git-lfs.github.com/). Getting git lfs integrated to your workflow is as easy as [installing it](https://git-lfs.github.com/), adding it to your `$PATH` and running:
```
git lfs install
```
to set up [lfs hooks and filters](https://github.com/git-lfs/git-lfs/blob/master/docs/man/git-lfs-install.1.ronn). You can then simply proceed as normal!
