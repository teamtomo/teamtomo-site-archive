# Introduction

In this tutorial, we will reprocess a five tilt-series subset of 
[*EMPIAR-10164*](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/pdbe/emdb/empiar/entry/10164/), 
a cryo-ET dataset of HIV-1 virus like particles (VLPs) from the 
[Briggs group](https://www2.mrc-lmb.cam.ac.uk/groups/briggs/).

Data will be processed *ab initio*, highlighting many important concepts and 
exposing you to powerful tools which will help with your own data processing needs.

```{note}
This subset was used to benchmark both 
[NovaCTF](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1047847717301272)
and 
[Warp](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41592-019-0580-y).
```

This processing will be carried out combining the 
[Warp-RELION-M](http://www.warpem.com/warp/?page_id=827) 
pipeline with tools from 
[Dynamo](https://wiki.dynamo.biozentrum.unibas.ch/w/index.php/Main_Page).
Combination of these tools yields a powerful, 
flexible framework for *ab initio* and geometrical approaches to subtomogram averaging,
benefitting from multi-particle refinement in [M](http://www.warpem.com/warp/?page_id=827).

From these five tilt-series, this procedure can produce a **3.4 Ã…** reconstruction 
of the HIV-1 CA-SP1 hexamer.

## A note about scripting
As the software ecosystem for cryo-ET matures, some scripting is often required to achieve your goals. 
This tutorial is provided with all necessary 
[scripts](https://github.com/teamtomo/teamtomo.github.io/tree/master/walkthroughs/EMPIAR-10164/scripts).

For illustrative purposes, the contents of these scripts will appear as `code blocks` in the tutorial when used. 

```matlab
% this is a comment
disp('Hello World!')
```

Reading these blocks is intended to serve as a gentle introduction to MATLAB scripting for working with
the powerful tools Dynamo has to offer.

For general purpose scripting, we personally prefer `Python` for its wealth of open source
[data science infrastructure](https://www.scipy.org/) 
and 
[educational resources](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5rNu16O3YNE&t=4103s).

## Requirements and Setup
````{tab-set}
```{tab-item} Hardware
- A reasonably modern CPU.
- At least 32 GB RAM.
- At least 1 NVIDIA GPU, with at least 8 GB of dedicated memory.
- At least 10 GB of free disk space.

More RAM will be required for particle extraction at the smallest pixel sizes; we used a machine with 128GB.
To keep read/write times low, we recommend a Solid State Drive (SSD).
```


```{tab-item} Software
- Access to both Windows and Linux operating systems
- [MATLAB](https://fr.mathworks.com/products/matlab.html) r2019a or later with the following toolboxes installed
  - Image Processing Toolbox
  - Parallel Computing Toolbox
  - Computer Vision Toolbox
  - Curve Fitting Toolbox
- [IMOD](https://bio3d.colorado.edu/imod/)
- [Warp](http://www.warpem.com/) v1.0.9 or later
- [Relion](https://www3.mrc-lmb.cam.ac.uk/relion/index.php?title=Main_Page) 3.0.8 or later
- [Dynamo](https://wiki.dynamo.biozentrum.unibas.ch/w/index.php/Main_Page) 1.1.478 or later
- [dynamo2m](https://github.com/alisterburt/dynamo2m)
- [autoalign_dynamo](https://github.com/alisterburt/autoalign_dynamo)
- [scripts](https://github.com/teamtomo/teamtomo.github.io/tree/master/walkthroughs/EMPIAR-10164/scripts) provided with this guide
